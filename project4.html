    <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
    <p>
        Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only, and is responsible for the look and feel of a website, while the functionality is provided by other libraries, such as AngularJS, React, or Vue.js, among others, or built on top of the Java-based Spring platform, or the ASP.NET platform. It is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with over 145,000 stars and more than 74,000 forks, as of July 2020, after freeCodeCamp, which has over 312,000 stars and more than 20,000 forks. Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto: "A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.
